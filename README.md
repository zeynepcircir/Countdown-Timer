# Countdown-Timer
A study that Ä± have done to improve my javaScript skills and improve myself in build ing algorithms.
This is a little rock paper scissors game. Let me explain its features in items:
*When I press the start button, my rock paper scissors buttons become active.
*For each choice of the player, the computer also makes a choice and the winner's counter increases. In case of a draw, the counter does not change.
*At the end of 10 hands, the winner is determined.
*Selections and winners are listed on the leaderboard at the bottom of the page.
